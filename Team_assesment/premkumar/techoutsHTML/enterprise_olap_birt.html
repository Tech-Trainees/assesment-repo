                <p>Our client uses OLAP technology to organize enterprise database and support business intelligence. Microsoft Excel OLAP analysis tool is used to retrieve OLAP data, and display as pivot table report. Also clipse BIRT(Business Intelligence Reporting tool) is used for various reporting and data visualization needs.</p>

                <h3 class="caseDetailsHeadingTitle">Challenge</h3>
                <div class="caseDetailsParagraphText">
                    <p class="caseDetailsParagraphText">With the current approach of using client based applications (BIRT report designer, Microsoft Excel), sharing of reports securely turned out to be blocker. Though Eclipse BIRT provides standalone BIRT runtime viewer, which enables web based viewing, but lacks security because any user can view data after knowing report access link. The current process involves authoring reports and emailing reports/link, which adds unnecessary layer to current sharing and security issues.</p>
                    <p>The experts also suggested increasing the server configuration, installing dispatcher to increase the security of AEM instance, redirecting the old URLs to new ones, clearing cache to publish new pages easily. The team decided to go ahead with the integration of AEM Campaign with Adobe suite to monitor user activity and profile creation for further segmentation.</p>
