<h3 class="caseDetailsHeadingTitle">We have done below as part of QC activities:</h3>
<div class="caseDetailsParagraphText">
<ul>
<li>We have divided our Quality team into two, one Functional, and other Regression</li>
<li>Functional team will validate all the new features, while regression team works with previous release build to unhide all the issues existing in the system</li>
<li>We have uncovered all the major issues, and our development team on support has resolved the issues to make the application stable</li>
<li>As part of regression we have done performance testing and provided suggestions to improve cache mechanism, to implement SOLR for search and were able to meet Performance requirements</li>
<li>During regression testing we have done Web Application security (OWASP) and uncovered major vulnerabilities in the application to make it more secure</li>
<li>For the new features we have ensured maximum test coverage is achieved</li>
<li>To avoid integration issues, we have requested for an environment with all the integrations and have done exhaustive integration testing and have used SOAP UI for testing web services wherever required</li>
<li>We have also prepared E2E scenarios and have automated the regression suite, to reduce manual efforts and quick identification of issues during the code merges</li>
