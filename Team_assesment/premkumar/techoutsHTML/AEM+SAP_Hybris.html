		<h3>Leveraging Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), SAP Commerce Cloud (formerly SAP Hybris Commerce), and SAP CRM to deliver better customer experiences.</h3>
       
        <h4>About Customer</h4>
        <p>Our customer is a leading dental equipment manufacturer and supplier (headquarters: USA), with factories in 10 countries and operations in more than 118 countries. Our customer – develops, manufactures, and markets comprehensive solutions offering dental and oral health care products.</p>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Factories in 10 countries and operations in more than 118 countries!<br>
        How can the globalization model be developed, run customized promotions, personalize products view based on user location, restrict users, and what not? How can every customer touchpoint with the brand be mapped to deliver a seamless experience? Can the brand make sure every interaction with the company is meaningful and memorable so the ultimate goal to build a customer-centric organization is achieved?</p>
        <p>With Techouts’ assistance, customer launched a completely redesigned website for the market that is simple, easy to use, and intuitive. The digital transformation approach we suggested made it easy for their partners and buyers to interact with the company, order products online, and have a mobile app to deliver omnichannel engagement.</p>
        <h4>Systems that are customized by Techouts and provided business support:</h4>

        <h1>SAP + AEM: Developing, Customizing and Implementing</h1>
        <p>Enterprise-level systems like SAP Commerce Cloud, AEM, Analytics, Target and CRM, and middleware systems like BizTalk, additional CX systems like AI-based Chatbot, and product development related to pricing and promotions engine. Apart from customizing these systems, we have also decided to incorporate microservices developed for each system and design integration touchpoints.</p>
        <h4>Customizing AEM and SAP Commerce Cloud B2B</h4>
        <p>All the products are categorized and APIs are developed using REST architecture for the entire array of available products and product lines. We have developed a microservice to call these APIs from AEM, based on various personalizing parameters so that users can be restricted to certain categories if they are from a different country.</p>
        <h4>Globalization: AEM + SAP Commerce Cloud B2B</h4>
        <p>In order to achieve AEM and SAP Commerce Cloud integration, we have designed to leverage templates from both systems. AEM templates are developed based on template customization on SAP Hybris. We made sure this solution is designed to be user-friendly for content administrators and provides an ease to call the desired categories, and customized promotions based on user location and purchased history.<br>
        We have used AEM advanced geo store approach, journey tracking from Adobe Analytics, and Adobe Target to finally push the personalized content.</p>
        <h4>Single Sign on (SSO) development</h4>
        <p>With disparate systems ranging from AEM, SAP Hybris to downstream systems like Analytics and personalizing engines from a completely different platform, we have developed a single sign-on (SSO) system to provide users unified access and easiness of authoring / administrating these systems.</p>
        <p>For our clients who have a wide system and target millions of customers, we always suggest having an SSO developed, so as to simplify administrators’ touchpoints.</p>
        <p>We have also migrated user accounts and loyalty enhancements were done resulting in a flawless transformation of processes to enterprise-ready digital systems.</p>
        <h4>SAP Commerce Cloud B2B customizations: The eCommerce engine</h4>
        <p>SAP Commerce Cloud is the core system developed and customized to connect with the various systems. We call it the heart of the entire transactional journey.</p>
        <p>Visibility restriction parameters were incorporated to limit product visibility based on the levels these users are subscribed to and the geography. Integrating SSO using SAML and providing login access to the Hybris system, an entire Azure policy was created and customized.</p>
        <h4>SAP Commerce Cloud enablement</h4>
        <p>We have enabled marketplace – our client has partners who sell their products directly through our client’s B2B website.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>We have developed and customized the Hybris system and enabled marketplace based transactional journey</li>
        <li>Enabled language customization based on regions</li>
        <li>B2B enablement</li>
        <li>SEO features development</li>
        <li>3rd party systems like loyalty, credit, tax engine, and email were integrated with Hybris</li>
        </ul>
