			<div class="entry-content">

				<p>A content management system, commonly abbreviated as CMS, is a software application used for producing and managing a website. It enables anyone, even those without a formal technical background, to place content on a website and keep track of it with ease.</p>
<p>Using a CMS to power your site could be one of the best investments you make in your digital presence and your business. Using a CMS to power your site could be one of the best investments you make in your digital presence and your business which will lead you to comfort with the below features:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">

<li>Streamlines scheduling and improves site maintenance</li>
<li>Design changes are simple and helps you manage the content</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Have a look at how companies are adapting to CMS:</h3>
<p>One of the biggest retailer companies in the world with more than 12,000 stores in 30 countries had several key selection criteria when looking for a new experience management solution and they lacked a CMS to bring together multiple parts of the customer experience. In a contentious evaluation process where multiple solutions were considered, they chose&nbsp;open and flexible CMS&nbsp;built to drive results faster.</p>
<p>With the CMS adaption, the company had reduced operational costs with faster and more cost-effective development that led to accelerated time-to-market with new features and innovations. They had improved team productivity agility along with an increase in flexibility to upgrade and customize its digital commerce platform. In a business, where many people can have access to your website — starting from those who add product pages to those who produce huge consumer-centric posts for your content marketing efforts, a CMS makes it easy to manage roles and publishing permissions for all so that only those you allow can publish content and the content goes live only when you’re ready.</p>
<h3>Personalizing engines integration with CMS:</h3>
<p>Target integration with a full-featured CMS will allow you to personalize your content for any kind of audience. You can have access to the best data about your customers along with the digital intelligence necessary to make effective marketing decisions by integrating Target with the Adobe Marketing Cloud.</p>
<h3>CMS in the eCommerce Industry:</h3>
<p>Good content has the power to communicate information, educate, and change minds. It pulls in readers and helps you share your point of view and demonstrate expertise. Words may have been one of our oldest means of persuasive power but they are far from the only type of content. Photos,&nbsp;videos, and&nbsp;infographics, to name a few, can all be powerful methods of getting your message across to customers.</p>
<p>In an age of rising digital advertising costs, it’s no wonder that&nbsp;content marketing&nbsp;is being increasingly relied upon to draw in organic traffic and provide a better customer experience.</p>
<h3>Here are some quick facts on the rise of content in eCommerce systems:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Around half of all marketers plan to use content to reach their customers.</li>
<li>72% of businesses find that content marketing increases engagement.</li>
<li>64% of enterprises are looking for ways to create a better content strategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Businesses are starting to make changes to increase their content marketing budgets as CMS is playing a vital role in the digital era to attract customers.</p>
<h3>Why do large enterprises need to have CMS combined with a personalizing engine?</h3>
<p>As yet, we might seem like CMS evangelists, but the truth is- not every&nbsp;ecommerce&nbsp;store needs a separate CMS. Typically, the sites that need a CMS are ones that need to have their content refreshed frequently. Ecommerce sites often qualify because they keep updating the homepage content and product pages with new additions to keep things fresh.</p>
<h3>AEM as a CMS platform:</h3>
<p>AEM is a CMS offered by one of the globally renowned content management suites. This tool enables easy and dynamic digital asset management with document management solutions, social engagement options, community connection portals, and means to manage user-generated content.</p>
<p>Creative teams can use AEM as a central workstation and streamline their present work processes seamlessly. It also allows teams to work together in harmony from different locations and deliver attractive media to users across different channels.</p>
<h3>AEM along with Adobe target for better customer reach:</h3>
<p>Adobe Target is a personalization solution that makes it easy to identify and deliver your best content. It helps you create a targeted experience specific to each customer.</p>
<p>Adobe Target is built on the foundation of Adobe Experience Cloud (a collection of integrated online marketing and Web analytics products by Adobe) which integrates directly with Adobe core services including Adobe Launch (Tag management system), Adobe Experience Cloud Assets (Easily store, sync, and share all your digital assets in a central location, to save time and deliver a more consistent customer experience) and the Adobe Experience Cloud People core services (Create a comprehensive view of individual customers by connecting Adobe and non-Adobe data in your Experience Cloud solutions). These different core services provide information interchange between Adobe Experience Cloud solutions.</p>
