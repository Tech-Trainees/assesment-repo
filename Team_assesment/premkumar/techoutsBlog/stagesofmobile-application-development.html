			<div class="entry-content">

				<p>Ever since smart phones entered the technology scene, there was no turning back. Everything that happened afterward was beyond anybody’s imaginations. Within no time, smart phones have become the world’s constant companion for every human being. Many technologies have made their way into digital lives and the revenue from mobile app development has skyrocketed which lead to more mobile app development trends also started emerging and materializing along the way.</p>
<p>To create a successful mobile application, the initial step is to identify a problem that can be resolved by the desired app.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at the stages of a successful mobile application development.</p>
<h3>Project requirement discussion:</h3>
<p>If you want to create a product that sells, you need to build something that addresses the apparent needs of your audience. A project requirement discussion will fully define the value and purpose of a mobile app to your product and development teams. These discussions will give the foundation for a successful product, outlining business logic, listing technical specifications, and ultimately helping your development team transform your early concept into a fully functional app.</p>
<h5>Strategy:</h5>
<p>The mobile app development process needs to define the strategy for evolving the idea into a successful app. As one’s app objectives may differ from another, there is still an app-specific impact to the mobility strategy to address during the development process.</p>
<p>The strategy phase mainly includes the below steps to be defined for a successful outcome of the project.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Initial conversation</li>
<li>Goal definition</li>
<li>Competitive Audit</li>
<li>User Feedback</li>
<li>Goal Review</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Analysis and Planning:</h5>
<p>At the analysis and planning stage, the app idea starts taking shape and turns into an actual project. Analysis and planning begin by defining use cases and capturing detailed functional requirements.</p>
<p>Once the requirements for the app are identified, a product roadmap needs to be prepared which includes prioritizing the mobile app requirements and grouping them into delivery milestones. If time, resources, or costs are a concern, then the&nbsp;minimum-viable-product needs&nbsp;to be defined and prioritized for the initial launch.</p>
<p>The planning phase includes identifying the skills needed for the app development initiative. For iOS and Android mobile platforms, different development technology stacks are used. If the project goal is to build a mobile app for iOS and Android mobile platforms then, the mobile development team should include iOS developers and Android developers for the project in the analysis and planning stage.</p>
<h5>App Development:</h5>
<p>Planning is an integral part of the mobile app development process. Before development/programming efforts start the technical architecture and development, milestones need to be defined along with picking a technology stack for the successful development process initiation.</p>
<p>A mobile app project generally includes three integral parts:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Back-end/server technology</li>
<li>APIs</li>
<li>Mobile app front-end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Back-end/server technology:</h5>
<p>The development that occurs at the server-side is known as the backend development process. It’s a necessary part that stores, secures, and processes the data. A backend app is a server for the users to sort the required information which refers to the activities that happen behind the scenes when a task on an app is performed.</p>
<h5>APIs</h5>
<p>An API allows two applications to talk to each other in this process. API is a means for communication between the app and a back-end server/database.</p>
<h5>Mobile App Front-End</h5>
<p>This is a part of the development process that clients &amp; users see. It’s also known as client-side development. If you are shopping on an online app, the display you’re served with is the front-end development result. The front-end development comes with a challenge of the constant change of the tools and techniques used to create the website’s front end and so the developer needs to continually be informed of how the field is developing.</p>
<p>The objective of front-end development is to ensure that when the users open up the site, they see the information in a format that is easy to read and understand. The fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions complicates it further thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers, different operating systems, and different devices, which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.</p>
<h5>Testing:</h5>
<p>How do you ensure that each and every element, page, and feature of the mobile app adds up to an enticing experience and moves your user down the conversion funnel? There’s one way: harnessing the power of experimentation; and here’s where mobile app testing steps in.</p>
<p>Mobile app testing is a sort of A/B testing wherein multiple user segments are offered with different variations of an in-app experience to determine which one induces the desired action from them or has a positive impact on key app metrics. By figuring out what works for your mobile app and what doesn’t, you can systematically optimize it for your desired metrics and unlock limitless growth opportunities for businesses that were always lurking in plain sight.</p>
<h5>Monitoring:</h5>
<p>Thinking that the mobile app development process ends when the app is shipped would be incredibly naive. Moderately popular apps also have a long history of app updates. Those updates involve fixes, performance improvements, changes, and new features. Precise monitoring is imperative to best understand what sort of updates is needed. A few things you should be monitoring are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Error monitoring</li>
<li>Performance monitoring</li>
<li>Metrics</li>
<li>Tracking</li>
<li>Packaged information</li>
<li>Reports</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Deployment &amp; Support:</h5>
<p>Releasing a mobile app requires submitting your app to the app stores, Apple App Store for iOS apps, and Google Play for Android apps. Nevertheless, you will require a developer account with&nbsp;Apple App Store&nbsp;and&nbsp;Google Play Store&nbsp;before launching your mobile app.</p>
<p>An app’s release in the app store requires preparing metadata including:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>App’s Title</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Category</li>
<li>Keywords</li>
<li>Launch icon</li>
<li>App store screenshots</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
