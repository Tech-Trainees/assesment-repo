<li>Ensured that all the Integration Systems are working for every “Show and Tell” sessions</li>
<li>Included “Unit Testing” and TDD for all the code changes in each Sprint/Release</li>
<li>Suggested for a round of testing in Dev environment before releasing the code to testing</li>
<li>Incorporated End to End testing with Real Data before signing off the testing on SIT Environment to avoid any issues in UAT or Pre-Prod environments</li>
<li>Improved the test coverage by implementing reviews from Developers and QA Leads</li>
<li>Used JIRA for all the issue and user stories tracking, so that the communication between various teams is effective</li>

<div class="caseDetailsInnerContents">
<h3 class="caseDetailsHeadingTitle">We have done below as part of QC activities:</h3>
<div class="caseDetailsParagraphText">
<ul>
<li>Prepared the Test Plan for each Sprint and Release</li>
<li>Divided our Quality team into two: Functional &amp; Regression; Functional team would validate all the new features for the Sprint manually, while regression team used to ensure the automation scripts are up to date with new Sprint features automated as soon as they are stable</li>
<li>As part of Regression we have done performance testing by working closely with development team to form a performance engineering team for meeting the customer performance requirements</li>
<li>During regression testing we have done Web Application security (OWASP) and uncovered major vulnerabilities in the application to make it more secure</li>
<li>We have used SOAP UI for testing all the web services before starting the Integration with other systems</li>
<li>Also, tested the Fall-back mechanism for OMS using Clustering concept to ensure 24X7 availability of the OMS system</li>
</ul>
