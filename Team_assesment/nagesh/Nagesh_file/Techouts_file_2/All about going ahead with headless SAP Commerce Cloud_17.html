            <h3>What is headless eCommerce?</h3>
<p>The headless commerce architecture separates the platform’s core commerce functions (the back-end) like processing payments and keeping track of inventory from the customer interface (the front-end). By enabling customer interactions like 1-click checkouts or message-based sales channels to become more plug-and-play, the headless eCommerce offers a means for brands and retailers to more efficiently tap into emerging e-commerce mediums like voice, text, mobile, etc.</p>
<p>A rising number of platforms and lots of different devices are involved today in online transactions — from laptops to mobiles to smart speakers. Yet, a majority of the e-commerce infrastructure is built with just desktop computers in mind. Headless commerce could soon change that.</p>
<h3>How headless eCommerce work?</h3>
<p>Similarly likewise with a headless CMS, a headless eCommerce framework works by passing requests between the presentation and application layers through web services or application programming interface (API) calls. Let’s say, the user clicks the “Buy Now” button on their phone, the presentation layer of the headless eCommerce system sends an API call to the application layer for order processing. The application layer then sends another API call to the application layer to show the customer the order status.</p>
<h3>Headless commerce vs. traditional commerce</h3>
<p>Here’s a comparison between headless commerce and traditional commerce:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Flexible front-end development: The removal of the predefined front-end platform in headless commerce enables front-end developers to build a user experience from scratch which corresponds well with their core business needs. Front-end developers don’t need to worry about the database modification in the backend as all they have to do is make a simple API call.</li>
<li>Customization and personalization: Traditional platforms are implemented with a predefined experience for both your customer and the administrative user. With headless platforms, since there is no front-end, developers can create their own user experience from scratch and will have control over the look and feel of the commerce platform and also control over customer and admin views.</li>
<li>Flexibility and adaptability: In the traditional platform, the front-end is tightly linked with the back-end infrastructure and coding. But headless commerce generates endless possibilities for customization as and when required. You just need to have a front-end developer for any modifications. Any changes, big or small, from executing a custom checkout flow to adding a new field to a customer account — both are very straightforward to execute with headless commerce architecture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key benefits of having a Headless SAP Commerce Cloud (Formerly SAP Hybris) combined with AEM</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Truly Omnichannel: Hybris Combined with AEM, a content management system, will help propel web content anywhere and everywhere.</li>
<li>Remaining competitive: Headless Hybris commerce platform enables you to easily make any changes to your front-end using AEM which will coincide with the speed of consumer needs versus using a traditional platform usually roll out can extend to a few weeks.</li>
<li>To achieve agile marketing: Having Headless Hybris Commerce and AEM integrated puts marketing teams back into the driving seat where they can roll out multiple sites across different brands, divisions, and portfolios.</li>
<li>Way to make the customer experience more personal and consistent: Can leverage content personalizing engines like Adobe Target and Adobe Campaign, and based customer shopping data marketing teams can publish personalized content for customers.</li>
<li>For seamless integrations and better conversion optimization: Using AEM adding your brand to any new device, expanding opportunities won’t take months; just integrate your commerce platform to a new device can happen in hours versus days when you have AEM as your head CMS</li>
<li>Lower Development Costs: Implementation of headless commerce often results in savings as companies can assemble teams of highly skilled front-end developers because templates can be customized with a single AEM developer if React JS or HTML/CSS layer is ready.</li>
<li>Lower Load on Servers: It can take a significant load off of the servers if you move logic up to the headless layer. If you have a caching layer between the Hybris headless layer and AEM, you can drive an even greater reduction in the load of your eCommerce infrastructure.</li>
<li>Reduced Dependencies on Individual Technologies, and pave a path for more agile independent development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Now when can an enterprise or midsized company go Headless (SAP Commerce Cloud)?</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>If a company is currently using or are planning to use multiple channels to connect with its customers.</li>
<li>A commerce platform to be focused on user experience rather than on bare transactions.</li>
<li>If a company has plans to associate with technology vendors who have a wide pool of technical resources and a plethora of IT services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How effective is Headless SAP Hybris Commerce considering without AEM?</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Going Headless with SAP Commerce Cloud: Within the SAP С/4HANA platform that is part of the SAP Customer Experience (CX) Suite, SAP Commerce Cloud represents a comprehensive cloud-native flexible solution for B2B, B2C, and B2B2C companies.</li>
<li>There’s a distinct path for SAP towards rendering a headless commerce solution, to prove that SAP has built an open-source JavaScript web application named Spartacus<br>
So now the question is- why go Headless with Spartacus?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The SAP Commerce Cloud team developed Spartacus under an open-source license. Users can utilize the Spartacus delivered content without any additional cost. The open-source model also permits the SAP Commerce Cloud ecosystem to commit to the product easily, evolving the product faster. As a matter of fact, a Spartacus version is released every two weeks!</p>
<p>Headless commerce contravenes the old practice of packaging a commerce solution with a fully integrated storefront. The commerce solution now is a set of services instead, which can be used by any front-end solution.</p>
<h3>Benefits introduced with Spartacus approach:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Multiple customer-facing solutions can use the eCommerce services, delivering a true decoupled Omni-channel architecture including e-commerce, native Apps, or Progressive Web Applications (PWA).</li>
<li>Scalability and possibility to scale storefront and commerce independently from each other</li>
<li>Having separate development cycles between commerce and storefront make it possible to react quickly to changes in the market and cut down time to market considering enhancements and features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the ever-expanding gap between front-end and back-end technologies, more and more storefronts are adopting the headless commerce approach. It enables you to update your storefront UI independent of your backend system and applications offering the best customer experience. Launching headless eCommerce with SAP Commerce Cloud provides out-of-the-box automation and deployment capabilities via the Spartacus storefront. With a Spartacus-based UI, the diverse commerce capabilities such as product catalog, pricing, shopping cart, checkout, etc. can be easily managed thus offering a seamless, unified experience to the end-customer.</p>
