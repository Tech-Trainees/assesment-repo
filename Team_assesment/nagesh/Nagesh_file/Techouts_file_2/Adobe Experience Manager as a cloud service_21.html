            <h3>What’s Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service?</h3>
<p>Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service is another age software-as-a-service for experience management by Adobe. It is the most notable change that has happened to the AEM ecosystem over the last ten years. It is termed as the next big progression of the AEM On-Premise and AEM Managed Services versions. Recognizing the gap in the existing platforms, Adobe has concocted a full suite digital experience cloud solution to engage the digital customers better in all phases.</p>
<p>The solution has been altogether intended for the cloud and is scalable, secure, always accessible, and up-to-date.</p>
<p>Following the Magento acquisition by Adobe,&nbsp;<strong>Magento Commerce cloud</strong>&nbsp;got upgraded into a feature-rich and fully-functional&nbsp;<strong>E-commerce digital experience</strong>&nbsp;platform and has been incorporated into Adobe digital experience cloud for its commerce functionality. Adobe Experience Manager is pre-integrated into the Adobe Experience Cloud as a headless content management platform alongside other extensible features like the Adobe marketing cloud, Adobe advertising cloud, and Adobe analytics cloud to help business owners drive profitable results.</p>
<h5>Support from Adobe on AEM as Cloud Service</h5>
<p>Exactly the same Adobe support offerings apply to AEM as Cloud Service as to any other Adobe Experience Cloud products. Enterprise and Elite are the minima recommended support levels for AEM as Cloud Service.</p>
<h5>Best Strategy to start using Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service</h5>
<p>In case you are already an AEM customer, the first step will be preparing your organization for the change and updating to the latest version with AEM 6.5.</p>
<p>A stepwise migration path to AEM as a Cloud Service will be determined following Adobe’s best practices with the Digital Foundation Blueprint and the Core Components. Developing a brand new website from scratch is also a good approach.</p>
<h5>Developing and deploying new features for AEM as a Cloud Service</h5>
<p>The new features’ development is done locally and can be set up through the AEM as a Cloud Service SDK. It enables developers to configure and test the new features prior to their cloud deployment. The GIT repository associated with the Cloud Manager should store the application code and configuration.</p>
<p>As soon as a release gets ready, an AEM image must be created and pushed via the Cloud Manager pipeline. Before it gets effectively deployed on cloud environments, it should pass all the code quality, security, and performance gates as required.</p>
<h4>Tools to assist with the Migration</h4>
<p><strong>· Cloud readiness analyser: </strong>Evaluate readiness to shift from an existing AEM deployment to AEM as a Cloud Service.</p>
<p><strong>·Content transfer tool: </strong>Move the existing content over to the target AEM as a Cloud Service instance from a source AEM instance (on-premise or AMS).</p>
<p><strong>·</strong><strong>Asset workflow migration tool: </strong>Migrate the asset processing workflows from on-premise or managed service deployments automatically.</p>
<p><strong>·</strong><strong>AEM dispatcher converter: </strong>Provides the capability to convert the existing AMS dispatcher configurations to AEM as Cloud Service Dispatcher configurations.</p>
<h3>Why move to AEM as a Cloud Service?</h3>
<p><strong>·</strong><strong>Better CX transformation and acceleration:</strong></p>
<p>Instead of planning for and around version upgrades, AEM as a Cloud Service enables your team to focus on innovation with its new features and instant product updates. Enhanced customer experience and performance abilities drive a more customized, engaging experience to market faster – including native access to Adobe Sensei machine learning and AI services.</p>
<p><strong>·</strong><strong>Host and operate your on-premise AEM installation:</strong></p>
<p>It results in a significant reduction in IT and operational burdens while rendering better protection against cloud disasters and failures. Rather than big-bang upgrades, code adaptations, performance augmentations, and security updates are persistently carried out in small agile steps – no downtimes and content freeze necessary.</p>
<p><strong>·</strong><strong>Expand your CX footprint into new areas, channels, service lines:</strong></p>
<p>Your CX grows with your business with AEM as a cloud service. The auto-scaling and always-on service features assure the consistent, robust performance of your overall solution, while cloud-based microservices facilitate faster processing of assets and the ability to drive personalized content at scale.</p>
<p><strong>·</strong><strong>Decrease your whole cost of ownership associated with AEM/CX initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>Assuming this is the case, AEM as a Cloud Service ought to be considered as the next major release, and you must plan to upgrade accordingly. In case, you are not yet working on version 6.5, core support for 6.4 will cease by the end of April 2021. You should decide between an upgrade to 6.5 first, or a migration directly to AEM as a Cloud Service if feasible.</p>
<h3>Product Details and Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faster time to value:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As brands no longer need to develop bespoke customization for site experiences, you achieve a boost to content development. AEM as a Cloud Service offers production-quality CMS and DAM environments in minutes. For instance, new site experiences can be dispatched quickly and they go about as the foundation for future user experience innovations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud agility:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>CIOs no longer have to bother about building downtime with a current, scalable, and accessible application to support version upgrades and can rely on a production environment that is configured and continually maintained to be consistent with Adobe’s standard security practices and controls.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experience optimization</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>Stimulate sizable ROI by taking an action based on real-time knowledge of the customer, while acknowledging users’ choices. For instance, if the previous purchases have shown an interest for all items coloured blue and an email featuring coats, with Adobe Sensei, Adobe’s AI and machine learning framework, a brand can connect those insights to recommend blue coats in order to help convert the sale. Furthermore, Adobe Sensei allows brands to automatically tag images and videos so teams can zero in on creative work rather than manual tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Omni channel experiences:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Design and deliver experiences to users across any channel, device, or app. Brands can now zero in on content that will resonate with key audiences and preferences, and utilize built-in Adobe Sensei capabilities to all the more likely ensure mundane tasks of adjusting that content for multiple channels are automated. Simultaneously, the teams can save valuable time on project management and device optimization by working on multiple assets for the different channels.</p>
