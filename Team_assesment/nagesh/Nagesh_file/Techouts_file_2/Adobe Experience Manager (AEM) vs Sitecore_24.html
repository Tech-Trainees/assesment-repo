            <p>A content management system (CMS) allows us to create, edit, manage and maintain website pages on a single interface. Companies can build sites for their clients using a CMS with relative ease. A CMS allows non-technical users to create functional pages, upload and modify content without needing programming skills.</p>
<p>Putting in place a robust and efficient CMS is a resource heavy and time consuming activity, even as a suitable CMS implementation can result in better business opportunities. To ensure efficient and targeted content creation, editing and management, it is imperative to select a content management system that is a good fit for the business requirements.</p>
<p>In here, we have tried to illustrate the strengths and shortcomings of two widely popular CMS systems: Adobe Experience Manager versus Sitecore CMS.</p>
<h3>Adobe Experience Manager</h3>
<p>Adobe Experience Manager is an enterprise grade CMS, part of Adobe’s Marketing Cloud that helps to engage website users, manage digital content and deliver personalized user experience across different channels (in-store, mobile, social, etc.).</p>
<p>When it comes to its advantages, AEM enables managing multiple sites using just one solution and translates pages into different languages. It is especially helpful when the business has a complex website and markets its products in different countries / regions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the solution helps to increase traffic to websites and boost conversion rates. AEM provides ready-made templates and allows the creation of personalized campaigns and CTAs with tracking. The feature called AEM Forms allows creating personalized and interactive documents that engage visitors and facilitate communication with them.</p>
<p>This product integrates with Adobe Creative Cloud, Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, Adobe Campaign (it facilitates creating email campaigns) and provides APIs that enable additional extensions.</p>
<h3>SiteCore</h3>
<p>Sitecore is a very powerful .NET framework which is amenable to customization to the business’ core interface. It comes with a modular templated architecture that is based on data templates. It is a multisite multilingual tool that is easy to update and comes with a host of marketing</p>
<p>Sitecore’s features are designed to support enterprise-level requirements and can easily be used in high-traffic sites. It is simple to use for those in the content field and is also highly flexible provided by in-depth APIs and comes with great features for developers. It saves time spent on managing content and documents. The greatest advantage is that it allows non-technical staff to manage documents directly.</p>
<p>Sitecore comes with very good eCommerce capabilities. The capabilities of a CMS can be extended and transformed into a comprehensive platform for Digital Enterprise that embraces sales and content management via Sitecore Experience Commerce</p>
<p>However, for someone with for basic CMS needs, it can prove to be expensive. Also, the Sitecore-based website development requires heavy programming, as the solution is “empty” and lacks a well-defined structure.</p>
<p>Also, when it comes to moving to the cloud, Sitecore has not been as quick as its competitors which can cause various issues. Recently, Sitecore has begun utilizing the cloud in a phased manner.</p>
<h3>Inference</h3>
<p>Sitecore and AEM can both perform efficiently and add value to businesses if properly customized. But in summary, if a company runs multiple diverse businesses, it is very possible they will find Sitecore to be the right fit for them, while for organizations that wish to enhance their focus on content-sharing, Adobe Experience Manager will fit the bill..</p>
