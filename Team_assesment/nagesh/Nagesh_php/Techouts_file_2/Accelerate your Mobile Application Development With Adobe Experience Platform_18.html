            <p>First, let’s have a glance at the new features and capabilities of Adobe Experience Platform Launch that will help manage Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK to accelerate mobile application development.<br>
Techouts intends to give users a great mobile experience and that involves constant evaluation of how users interact with the app and respond to updates and optimizations. Keeping this and other such guiding principles in view, we developed Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK from the ground up to be modular, flexible, and dynamic. Operating mobile SDKs through Adobe Experience Platform Launch brings a host of new features and capabilities that enable you to better engage with your users with meaningful personalization.</p>
<h3>How does Adobe Experience Manager Apps build and deploy?</h3>
<p>•AEM is integrated with Adobe PhoneGap alongside the Build service to simplify the application build and deploy process.<br>
•ContentSync facilitates users to download page and content updates Over-the-Air (OTA) to their devices without having to re-install the application or download from AppStore, Google Play, or other app sources.<br>
•Adobe Analytics is entirely integrated into AEM apps and this enables detailed tracking of distribution, geolocation, operating systems, devices, click-streams, time spent on an app, crash reports, iBeacon tracking, and a lot more.</p>
<h3>Integration with Adobe Mobile Services</h3>
<p>AEM Mobile integrates with Adobe Mobile Services to provide constantly expanding app marketing functionalities:<br>
•<strong>Analytics:</strong><br>
Analytic integration helps marketers to measure and analyze how different groups of users engage with the app. This data is gathered with the Mobile Services SDK that is automatically included in the app.<br>
•<strong>In-App messaging:</strong><br>
In-App messaging enables marketers to create custom in-app messages (full-screen notifications, native alerts, and local notifications) and trigger these messages based on user’s actions, lifecycle metrics, or geolocation without any app development.<br>
•<strong>Push notifications:</strong><br>
This feature can be configured to send push messages outside the app for Android and iOS users based on user segments, time, and location.<br>
•<strong>Acquisition tracking:</strong><br>
This feature allows marketers to create links to their apps and analyze what is driving the most app store downloads.</p>
<h3>AEM Mobile App Creation Workflow</h3>
<p>Using Adobe Experience Manager to create an AEM Mobile app and provide mobile content is an efficient multi-channel solution. The AEM mobile app development process involves designers, developers, and marketers.<br>
The process involves various steps as mentioned below:</p>
<p>•First of all, the developer logs in into the AEM Mobile On-Demand Portal and creates a new app project.<br>
•There are a few steps that the developer follows to integrate the AEM Authoring environment (on-premise or in the cloud) with AEM Mobile.<br>
•Designers begin forming the app’s experience with custom layout and navigation. They additionally characterize the style of AEM Mobile Articles, in other words, the actual mobile content.<br>
•Normally, limited default templates are never sufficient to achieve marketers’ goals which call for the development effort.<br>
•The developers then build custom AEM templates and components for AEM mobile-specific content in the AEM Authoring environment.<br>
•On the off chance that enterprise marketers already have pages in AEM (web content) and want to showcase the same content in the app (mobile content), then developers need to work on creating workflows to transform web content into mobile content.<br>
•Marketers build mobile content in the familiar AEM Authoring environment by selecting custom templates and components.<br>
•Developers design, sign and distribute the actual app. The strain of maintaining certificates, provisioning profiles, managing test devices, and users can be automated to provide a constant delivery directly into the app stores.<br>
•The Preflight app expedites the app development by allowing to view and test AEM Mobile content without the actual app.<br>
•Ultimately, users install the app on their mobile devices through each mobile platform’s app store or internal distribution system.</p>
<p>It’s worth bearing in mind that the actual mobile app that gets installed on the user’s device acts just as a display of the content. The mobile content gets pushed from the AEM Authoring environment into AEM Mobile On-Demand Services. At that point, AEM Mobile Delivery Services delivers the content to the app users via content delivery network servers. This procedure enables marketers to create, update and push new content to the mobile user without updating the actual app on the device.</p>
<p>Top Features of the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs<br>
Let’s have a look at some of the top features of the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs and how managing those with Launch can accelerate your mobile application development.</p>
<p>•<strong>Platforms Support</strong><br>
We can implement the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK across a variety of platforms. We use dependency managers (CocoaPods and Gradle) for Android and iOS to ensure that we pull the correct versions of the extensions and any essential dependent files. Likewise, we support additional platforms such as React Native, Flutter, and WeChat Mini Programs. Shortly we would also provide support for Apache Cordova, Xamarin, and Unity and easily activate Adobe Experience Cloud solutions in Launch.<br>
Numerous enterprises and organizations already use Adobe Experience Platform Launch for website tag management and configuration. For mobile, Launch allows you to build and manage mobile properties rendering a familiar set of controls and workflow paradigms for managing app implementations. Getting started with Launch’s mobile workflows is easy. When you activate Launch for mobile applications, it does not require its use on your website or vice versa.</p>
<p>•<strong>Dynamic Updates</strong><br>
At the point when you build your application with the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK, you retain a dynamic link back to your Adobe Experience Platform Launch property. This live link lets you push configuration and resource updates to your application dynamically without requiring a developer to rebuild or resubmit a new version of the app each time.<br>
Think of the number of times you wished you could change an Adobe Analytics report suite or an Adobe Target client code but decided not to because it would require you to resubmit your application.<br>
The launch likewise presents a publishing process that allows you to phase-gate your changes, first testing in development, staging, and finally production.</p>
<p>•<strong>Extensions</strong><br>
The Mobile Core event hub lies at the heart of the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK. It provides the core data structure bound to all SDK extensions, maintaining a list of registered extensions and internal modules, a list of registered event listeners, and a shared state database.<br>
The event hub then distributes and receives event data from registered extensions to simplify integrations with Adobe and third-party solutions. Clients too can build private extensions to connect with internal business systems that they wish to integrate into mobile workflows.</p>
<p>•<strong>Data Elements</strong><br>
The data elements present in the Adobe Experience Platform Launch act as aliases, making it easier to access data flowing through your mobile SDK implementation from both Adobe solutions and third-party extensions. Employing the same data elements, customers can easily reference or use data as a workflow trigger, or condition. This way, it’s easier to include mobile data such as context data, IDs, or anything else in post-backs to external endpoints.</p>
<h5>Why should we use Adobe Experience Manager Apps?</h5>
<p>Adobe PhoneGap Enterprise avails the features of both Apache Cordova and Adobe PhoneGap to create and manage content-rich cross-platform mobile applications using AEM as a platform that takes full advantage of both HTML and Native Device Features:</p>
<p>•All your company’s mobile apps, whether 100% native or hybrid, can now be managed at one place within PhoneGap Enterprise.<br>
•You can review the apps in development and staging environments without the intricacies of provisioning profiles and the additional effort to build and upload your app for sharing. Look at the PhoneGap Enterprise App in both AppStore and PlayStore for how this can be easily done.<br>
•The AEM page authoring environment can be utilized to create and manage rich content for your apps, including single-page app (SPA) reference implementations.<br>
•The HTML can be used with Adobe PhoneGap to create a mobile app container, page templates, and components with device-native capabilities (including, for instance, native transitions between pages for a smoother and more performant experience).<br>
•Mobile content can be curated and managed into new or pre-existing native apps through Cordova Web View integration with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).<br>
•The content needs to get shared across all delivery channels including, web, mobile-web, mobile-app, and print. The content is handled within Assets and through Adobe S7 capabilities, one can very easily stream (online) or package (offline) images and videos focusing on all viewports (attributes like size and quality for images/video to support all screen sizes and bandwidth limitations.).</p>
<p>One can create, update and delete content in AEM Apps in much the same way as within AEM Sites. The number of pages of managed content and last modified is displayed by The Content Tile. The content can be drilled into to create, copy, move, delete and update pages by tapping on each record in the tile.</p>
<p>Aside from overseeing content from Mobile App List Console, you can also manage it through CRXDE Lite. The PhoneGap URL connects with the PhoneGap Build Tile to build and host remote builds. You need to configure this tile by creating or using an existing Adobe ID to connect to the PhoneGap.</p>
<p>Subsequent to configuring, you can build the app remotely or by downloading the source. In case it’s built remotely, the build is made available either as a download or directly to your device via a QR code.</p>
<p>Employing the Adobe Experience platform in your mobile app development process brings you innumerable benefits. Coming to user interaction, you track information about your users and attain an understanding of what screens are being viewed the most and what other actions they’re taking inside the app. You can test if the new feature introduced settles well with the user. Next, when it comes to lifecycle metrics, you can keep a check on events like installs, crashes, etc. to analyze how the app is performing. Whilst this might all seem a little underwhelming, you can always opt for a technology partner to help you out with the process. And who better than an Adobe Implementation Partner for 7 years – Techouts. Our experts leverage the many benefits offered by Adobe Experience Cloud to employ in the mobile app development process and provide a base for cutting-edge technology in a digital medium for you to reap the maximum business benefits.</p>
