I have made a login page in which there will be two buttons i.e login and signup
onclicking signup the signup form will be open in the same router where there will be basic details to signup 
IN singup form only there will be three buttons one "register" which is used after filling details and after filling if we click register form the details will be stored in local storage 
there will be another button which is clear button  if we click clear button the details filled in form will become empty.
the third button is like if we already have account if we click on "clickhere" we will go to login page.
after registering when we come to login there the credentials should be given which we have stored in local storage.
If we give correct credentialswe will go be going to dashboard page which is another router 
In landingpage we have logout button if we click we will be redirect to login page
